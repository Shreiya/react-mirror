{"name":"React-mirror","tagline":"Smart mirror using ReactJS","body":"\r\n# React Mirror\r\nThis project is inspired by Evan Cohen's [SmartMirror](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror) which in turn was inspired by the respective projects [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). \r\nI'm taking this as an opportunity to pick up [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), better late than never :)\r\n\r\nAnd also since Evan Cohen's SmartMirror was using [forecast.io](http://forecast.io/), which doesn't support metric units, i decided to hack around and use [openweather](http://www.openweathermap.com/api) instead.\r\n## To-do\r\n- Make browserify \"watch\" source changes whenever i save\r\n- Using localstorage to \"remember\" my name\r\n- Beautify the screen\r\n- Add more commands and integration with Annyang\r\n- Customize SpeechSynthesisUtterance to have a nicer voice\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nUse your favourite IDE, or use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) like i do and install the following packages globally\r\n* babel-cli\r\n* browserify\r\n\r\nSign up an account with [openweather](http://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in) and replace config.js with your own API_KEY.\r\n\r\nInstall Node.js, run `npm install` to download the dependencies, then start the server.\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\nbrowserify -t [ babelify --presets [ react ] ] src/main.js -o src/bundle.js\r\npython server.py\r\n```\r\n### More info\r\n##### Why i use node.js?\r\nBecause i am lazy to reference other projects manually in `<script>` tags, and it's time for me to use some frontend dependency management tools. Just fill up `package.json` run `npm install` and all your dependencies are loaded, what more can i ask for?\r\n##### Why is there a need for python to host the server then?\r\nBecause i only want to use node for the packages, i can and/or i might change it to node, or send me a pull request and i'll gladly accept.\r\n### License\r\n[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/)\r\n","google":"UA-25044811-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
